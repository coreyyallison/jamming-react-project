# Jamming React Project

##Description:
This project from Codecademy.com is a website that will give you the option to search for a song by title name/artist/album name and then add it to a playlist named as whatever you choose. Once you are done, it will create the new playlist with associated songs to your actual spotify account to be used later.

## Purpose: 
For this project, we are working with class componenets in React to practice setting and changing the state of a component. WE also work with API's to practice working with keys. Most of the CSS was already given from Codecademy.com and the rest came from the started package of React.

##Issues: While I finished all the main requirements, there are still some issues and exta features I am working on at the moment.
	1. When you search for a term to start the use of the site, it refreshed back to a blank page (once you verify your account through spotify). If you revisit the site after logging in, your first term search will refresh the page. The goal is to get it to not refresh to a blank page after you login to spotify as well as later if you use the site again.
	2. An extra feature I have added/working on is the preview audio for each track searched. The only issue I am running into on this one is the visuals of the controls need to be changed. I have looked into a couple different options such as putting in a button and using 'onClick' for the id of the track.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
